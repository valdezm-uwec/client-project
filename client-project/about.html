                <h4>Fitness Journey</h4>
                <p>A tired, frazzled mom. A burned out teacher skipping breakfast. That's where I was when I found BODi. After getting off of a Disney cruise, I felt fluffy from a lack of daily fitness and a bit overwhelmed with my nutrition over the previous 10 days of the all you can eat buffets and dessert bars. I wanted to change. I needed to change. I also had this nagging feeling that God had something else in store for me. I wanted friendship, fitness, and fun all wrapped up in a neat package. What's interesting is I didn't know I wanted it until after I said YES to my coach, Deb. Her guidance (and patience) led me to this team after being an active Beachbody customer for 10 months. Coaching was a part of this business that I never thought I wanted or needed. It has changed my life. More friends. More fitness. More fun. More YES moments in my life.</p>

                <h4>Personal Life</h4>
                <p>My mission to share God's love with students, especially 5th graders, has continued for 27 years. I'm blessed to teach at a school that puts Christ first. When I'm not teaching I enjoy working at a local winery where I get to meet people from all over the country and share tropical fruit wines with them. In summer you can find me at the beach, on a golf course, or at a country concert.</p>
